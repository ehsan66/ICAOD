\usage{
on_average_ica(fimfunc, lx, ux, prior, param, iter, k, control = list(),
  initial = NULL, ...)
}
\arguments{
\item{fimfunc}{FIM as a \code{function} or a \code{character} string. See \link{mica} argument.}

\item{lx}{lower bound of the design space \eqn{\chi}.}

\item{ux}{upper bound of the design space \eqn{\chi}.}

\item{prior}{a vector of probability measure \eqn{\pi}.}

\item{param}{a matrix for set of parameters, i.e. support of \eqn{\pi}. Every row is is a vector of values of parameters.
The number of its rows must be equal to the length of \code{prior}.}

\item{iter}{maximum number of iterations.}

\item{k}{number of design (support) points. Must be larger than the number of model parameters \eqn{p} to avoid singularity of the FIM.}

\item{control}{a list of control parameters. See "Details" of \code{\link{mica}}.}

\item{initial}{initial a matrix of user intial countries or
a vector of a country that will be inserted  into the initial countries of ICA. See "Details" of \code{\link{mica}}.}

\item{...}{further arguments to be passed to the FIM function corresponding to \code{fimfunc}. For power logisitc model when \code{fimfunc} is equal to \code{FIM_power_logistic}, the value of  \code{s} should be given here.}
}
\value{
an object of class "ICA". See "Value" in \code{\link{mica}}.

\description{
For nonlinear models, if a set of possible values of the vector parameters \eqn{\bold{\theta}} is available, the optimum-on-the-average designs
can be applied. In this approach the criterion is evaluated at plausible parameter values and weighted by a probability measure
\eqn{\pi}, the measure having support in the parameter space \eqn{\Theta}. The resulted weighted criterion is thus
\deqn{B(\xi, \pi) = \int_{\Theta}\Psi(\xi, \theta)d(\pi(\theta)).}{B(\xi, \Pi) = \int_{\Theta}\Psi(\xi, \theta)d(\pi(\theta)).}
For current version \eqn{\Psi(\xi, \theta)} is equal to \eqn{|M(\xi, \theta)|}.
