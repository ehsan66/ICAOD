\usage{
multica_4pl(lx, ux, param, iter, k, delta, lambda, control = list(),

}
\arguments{
\item{lx}{lower bound of the design space \eqn{\chi}.}

\item{ux}{upper bound of the design space \eqn{\chi}.}

\item{param}{initial guess of parameters \eqn{\bold{\theta} = (\theta_1, \theta_2, \theta_3, \theta_4)}{\bold{\theta} = (\theta1, \theta2, \theta3, \theta4)}.}

\item{iter}{maximum number of iterations.}

\item{k}{number of design (support) points. Must be larger than the number of model parameters \eqn{4} to avoid singularity of the FIM.}

\item{delta}{numeric, predetermined clinically significant effect to define the MED.
When the dose-response relationship (slop \eqn{\theta_2}{\theta2}) is decreasing (increasing), the value of \code{delta} is negative (positive).}

\item{lambda}{user select weights, where \eqn{\lambda_1}{\lambda1} is the weight for estimating parameters,
\eqn{\lambda_2}{\lambda2} is the weignt for estimating median effective dose level (ED50), and \eqn{\lambda_3}{\lambda3} is the weight for estimating minimum effective dose level (MED).}

\item{control}{a list of control parameters. See "Details" of \code{\link{mica}}.}

\item{initial}{initial a matrix of user intial countries or
a vector of a country that will be inserted  into the initial countries of ICA. See "Details" of \code{\link{mica}}.}

\description{
The 4-parameter Hill model is \eqn{Y_i = f(D_i, a, b, c, d) + \epsilon_i}{Y_i = f(Di, a, b, c, d) + \epsiloni}
where \eqn{\epsilon_i \sim N(0, \sigma^2)}{\epsiloni ~ N(0, \sigma2)},
 \deqn{f(D_i, a,b, c, d) = c + \frac{(d-c)(\frac{D_i}{a})^b}{1+(\frac{D_i}{a})^b}}{
 f(Di, a,b, c, d) = c + (d-c)(Di/a)^b/(1 + (1 + Di)^b)} is the mean response at dose \eqn{D_i}{Di}, \eqn{a} is the ED50,
 \eqn{d} is the upper limit of response, \eqn{c} is the lower limit of response and \eqn{b} denotes the Hill constant that
 control the flexibility in the slope of the response curve.\cr
Let \eqn{\bold{\theta} = (\theta_1, \theta_2, \theta_3, \theta_4)}{\bold{\theta} = (\theta1, \theta2, \theta3, \theta4)}. The Hill model
 may be re-parameterized as
 \deqn{f(x, \bold{\theta}) = \frac{\theta_1}{1 + exp(\theta_2 x + \theta_3)} + \theta_4,}{
 f(x, \bold{\theta})= \theta1/(1 + exp(\theta2*x + \theta3)) + \theta4,}
 which is sometimes referred to as \strong{4-parameter logistic model}. This form is equivalent to
 Hill model with \eqn{\theta_1 = d - c}{\theta1 = d - c}, \eqn{\theta_2 = - b}{\theta2 = - b},
  \eqn{\theta_3 = b\log(a)}{\theta3 = blog(a)}, \eqn{\theta_4 = c}{\theta4 = c}, \eqn{\theta_1 > 0}{\theta1 > 0},
  \eqn{\theta_2 \neq 0}{\theta2 not equal to 0}, and \eqn{-\infty < ED50 < \infty}, where \eqn{x_i = log(D_i) \in [-M, M]}{xi = log(Di) belongs to [-M, M]}
  for some sufficiently large value of \eqn{M}. The user can easily transform \eqn{a}, \eqn{b}, \eqn{c}, \eqn{d} and \eqn{D}
   to \eqn{\theta_1}{\theta1}, \eqn{\theta_2}{\theta2}, \eqn{\theta_3}{\theta3}, \eqn{\theta_4}{\theta4}
    and \eqn{x} to find the multiple-objective optimal design for the 4-parameter logisitc model with this function and then
    transform the design for 4-parameter logistic model  to the 4-parameter Hill model. See "Examples". \cr
}
\details{
When \eqn{\lambda_1 > 0}{\lambda1 > 0}, then the number of support points \code{k} must at least be 4 to avoid singularity of the information matrix.\cr
This function is not suitable for finding the c-optimal designs for estimating 'MED' or 'ED50' and the results may not be stable.
 The reason is that for c-optimal the generalized inverese of Fisher information matrix unstable and depends
 on the tolerenace (probably because the matrix is exactly singular). \cr

 The tolerance for finding the general inverse of Fisher information matrix is set to \code{.Machine$double.xmin}.
